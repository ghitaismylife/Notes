#Requirements

#Make sure you have the following prerequisites in place before we start the installation process:

    Ubuntu 22.04 Virtono Server: Ensure that you have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04 on a dedicated server or virtual machine.
    Root or Sudo Access: To execute administrative tasks, you’ll need either root access or a user account with sudo privileges.
    Stable Internet Connection: A stable internet connection is essential, as we’ll be downloading packages and updates from the internet.
